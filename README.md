# Algorithms & Data Structures Cheat sheet

In this documentation, we'll be enumerating different algorithms and data structures and some problem solving tricks and tips

The code for the documentation will be mainly written in **Java**.

The documentation represents some key points and explanations on each of the algorithms or data structures stated and its implementations. We also state the time complexities of each of them.

Data structures listing is found [here](DataStructures/README.md).

Algorithms listing is found [here](Algorithms/README.md).
